                <p>Because we know. You probably tried learning a new skill before. 
                    It was hard or boring...or both. You know what’s weird, though? We’ve ALL 
                    learned a skill once! Sure, it took a bit of time, but all good things in 
                    life do. <br><br> That’s why we created a 3-step approach to learning that helps 
                    you acquire a new skill like you did the first time around: naturally. </p>
